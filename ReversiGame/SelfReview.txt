What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation?
Did you learn any lessons from the code given to you, or the updates you had to make for your
customers?

What was your experience like with your providers?

The only request for change by our clients were to clarify the Directions.java class. I'm pleased
with how we used Javadoc to explain our code thoroughly and used Interfaces to allow for solid
code extensibility throughout our implementation. One lesson we learned from providing code was to
focus on making enum classes and value classes very understandable and explain them thoroughly.
Even if we understand how the size in our model is calculated, some others may not. I know now to
make value classes their own and using proper Javadoc to explain their usage and how they are
calculated.
Our experience as providers was overall fairly positive. Our clients asked for our code initially
and asked for some small clarification on one small class, however, we were not asked to create any
new interfaces or change any major parts of our code.
