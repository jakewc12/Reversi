This is a Peer Review on the code given by Raymond Tsai and Dustin Zhang

How flexible are the interfaces you were given?

How capable are the views?

How convenient was it to reuse their code?

How cleanly written and well-documented was their code?

If you needed to request changes from them, what were they and why were they needed?

Write a short (3-4 paragraph) review of their code. Your review should have the following sections:
Design critique, implementation critique, documentation critique, design/code limitations and
suggestions on how to address them.

Please concentrate on writing a review that is honest, but constructive. The reader should be able
to understand what was wrong, and how to correct it. Please avoid simply criticizing the code given
to you with no suggestions on how to make it better. Similarly avoid blanket praise: every
implementation has flaws or limitations! Most importantly, please be professional in your writing.
In summary, write a review that you would not mind receiving and acting upon.
